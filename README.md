# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository holds the files to an AI Tic Tac Toe game as well as a Tic Tac Toe game played by the computer with randomly placed X's and O's.

The .txt file named "Tic Tac Toe - Random Placement" can be copy and pasted into P5 online text editor. This code shows two computer players placing X's and O's at random.

The other three files in the repository must be used in their own directory. This version of Tic Tac Toe uses the minimax algorithm to chose the best possible move with alpha-beta-pruning to be more efficient. This is an interactive game played against the computer where the computer will always choose the optimal move. 

All of the code in this repository is based off of the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ
